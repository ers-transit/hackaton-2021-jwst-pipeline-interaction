-------------------
During day 2, [Nestor Espinoza](http://nestor-espinoza.com/) gave a small tutorial on how to interact with the [JWST pipeline](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/) --- the `Interacting with the JWST pipeline --- the case of NIRISS.ipynb` file in this repository is the python notebook form of this tutorial; it has been uploaded compiled in case you don't want to run it on your computer --- but that is something we really encourage you to do! The talk associated with is [here](https://ers-transit.github.io/pre-launch-hackathon.html).

# Dependencies
--------------

The only dependency apart from being on the `ers-transit-tutorial` environment is to install the `jwst` library, which is the one of the calibration pipeline. Doing this is as simple as:

        pip install jwst

With that, you should be all set!
